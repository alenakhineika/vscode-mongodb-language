The VSCode JavaScript-based grammars are derived from the TypeScript grammar. VSCode uses `npm run update-grammars` script to update these grammars to the latest version of TypeScript. Since the MongoDB language grammar is not a part of VSCode repo, there is a helper that parses the `TypeScript.tmLanguage` plist and builds `mongodb.tmLanguage.json` grammar.
